# Dockerfile for Hub-Base
#
# This Hub-Base Dockerfile sets up a volume container used to persist, extract,
# and manage application configuration. It is split into two sections: Dynamic
# data mode for command line usage only, and static data mode for use as a
# Dockerfile.

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Dynamic data mode: run from image.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# `docker pull radial/hub-base` yields a non-versioned hub image that can be
# run "as is" and later linked up at run time via '--volumes-from' with it's
# Spoke container. All data stored in this container's exposed volumes are
# deleted when the containers are removed. 
# 
# Run with `-e "WHEEL_REPO=https://path.to.your/wheel/repo.git"` to download a
# configuration at runtime. You can specify multiple "WHEEL_REPO"
# configurations to download by appending something unique to "WHEEL_REPO". For
# example, "WHEEL_REPO_APP1" and "WHEEL_REPO_APP2" would work together.
#
# Your configuration should have it's own branch in your wheel repository,
# named "config" by default, with it's relative root being /config. If other
# branches are to be used, they must be prefixed with "WHEEL_BRANCH" with their 
# identifying segment identical to "WHEEL_REPO". "WHEEL_BRANCH_APP1" and
# WHEEL_BRANCH_APP2" for example. If no "WHEEL_BRANCH" variables are set, then the
# defualt branch "config" is used for each "WHEEL_REPO".

# When run from the image directly, the resulting container will:
# 1) Add the location of our wheel repository(s) and pull their config branches
#    to merge our Wheel configuration(s) together.
# 2) Set up file and folder permissions accordingly
# 3) Run our idling program
COPY            /HUB /HUB

ENTRYPOINT      ["/HUB", "dynamic"]

# NOTE: if you run this image dynamically, you must manually share the volumes
# '/config', '/data', '/log', and '/run' (if your Spokes need to communicate
# via sockets) if not already using `--volumes-from` other Axle containers
# that share these directories already.



# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Static data mode: built from Dockerfile
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# With one line, `FROM radial/hub-base` in a new Dockerfile, all files in the
# context are uploaded to the hub-container. Care must be taken to keep to the
# /config, /data/, /log, /run folder structure so that the files will upload
# correctly. Use a '.dockerignore' file in the hub folder to exclude items in
# the context from uploading.
#
# Create a file named 'build-env' and add it to the hub folder to insert
# additional ENV variables into our build. The variables here can be used to
# specify additional wheel repository(s) or alternate branch repositories at
# build time. It will be copied along with the contents of your '/config',
# '/data', and any other folders you create in the context.

# Later, all these directories are exposed with 'VOLUME'. This means that the
# files uploaded from the context are now subject to version control within
# docker AND WILL PERSIST AS PART OF THE RESULTING IMAGE. Not just stored
# temporarily in the running container. Use of a `.dockerignore` file is
# encouraged here.
ONBUILD COPY    / /

# Create the '/log' directory as a backup in case we don't use a log Axle
# container.
ONBUILD RUN     mkdir -p /data /log

# Make the copied files in '/config' a git repository so we can merge
# outside configuration into it.
ONBUILD WORKDIR /config
ONBUILD RUN     git init && (git add .; git commit -m "Configuration from COPY files" || true)

# If not explicitly using 'COPY' for configuration files, or if combining files
# locally and remotely, we need to source 'build-env' for the location of our
# additional configuration so we can pull it from those locations. 'build-env'
# is a series of `export SOME_VAR="value"` statements that is sourced before
# running our setup script.
#
# After this, file permissions are set on all the /config, /data, and /log
# directories.
ONBUILD ENV     ENV /build-env
ONBUILD RUN     test -f /build-env && source /build-env;\
                /HUB static

# Share our VOLUME directories
